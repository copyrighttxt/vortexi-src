RIP Vortexi. Made with ♥ by Kuromi & Ariez.

This is the full Vortexi source except for some API keys and other sensitive info.

Gameserver is pretty easy to setup. I'll let you figure that one out.

Webserver has sufficient documentation to get a simple Vortexi instance up

If you want to recreate the freedom of 2016+ (get it), you will have to do much more.

yours truly,
